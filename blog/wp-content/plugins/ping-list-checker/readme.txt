== Description == 
The Ping List Checker plugin for WordPress allows blog owners to verify if whether all sites in their ping list are unique or not. If duplicate entries are found, the plugin will report them and will display the number of times they were found in the list. This will help WordPress blog owners to ensure that a ping service is not pinged more than once, and is also very helpful to eliminate double pings which could lead to you getting tagged as a spammer!

2. Upload the whole plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
