Save your wordpress blog from getting tagged as ping spammer. Activation/subscription-free fork of MaxBlogPress Ping Optimizer plugin

== Description ==

Even the latest version of WordPress has this problem.

Do you know your WordPress blog pings unnecessarily every time you edit a post? Think how many times you click on "Save and Continue Editing" or "Save" button. Your blog will ping unnecessarily that many times you click on those buttons.

Save your blog from getting tagged as ping spammer by installing this plugin.

**After you install cbnet Ping Optimizer:**

* When you create a new post, your blog will ping and notify all the ping services that it has been updated. This encourages search engines and different blog directories/services to index your updated blog properly.

* When you edit an existing post, it won't send any unnecessary ping to ping services and saves your blog from getting banned by such services.

* When you post a future post by editing the time stamp, it will ping only when your post appears in future. It won't unnecessarily ping many times when you schedule posts as WordPress does by default.
